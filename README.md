# crop_identification

# Introduction
This project focuses on the development of a task recognition system using machine learning techniques to classify crop types from images. The primary goal is to accurately identify different types of crops from a given dataset, which includes images of ten different crops and bare land. Each class in the dataset contains 300 images with a resolution of 224x224 pixels.

The project is designed to implement a robust training and evaluation pipeline using PyTorch, applying various techniques such as data augmentation and regularization to improve model performance. The system's objective is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing crops, which has significant implications for agricultural analysis and precision farming.

# Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains images of crops, specifically organized into ten distinct crop types along with a class for bare land. Each class consists of 300 images, making the dataset balanced across all categories. The crops included in this dataset are:

* Guava
* Atemoya
* Carrot
* Cabbage
* Banana
* Grape
* Pineapple
* Mango
* Papaya
* Pumpkin
* Bare land
Each image has a resolution of 224x224 pixels, which has been standardized for consistency in model training and evaluation.

Data Transformation
The data undergoes specific preprocessing steps to enhance the model's learning process, including:

Training Data Transformations:

Resizing: All images are resized to the input size of 224x224 pixels to ensure uniformity.
Random Horizontal Flip: Flips the images horizontally with a probability of 50%, introducing variation in the training data.
Random Vertical Flip: Flips the images vertically with a probability of 50%, providing further augmentation.
Color Jitter: Randomly changes the brightness of the images to a maximum of 50%, adding brightness variation to make the model more robust to different lighting conditions.
Conversion to Tensor: Transforms the images into a tensor format suitable for input to a neural network.
Test Data Transformations:

Resizing: The test images are also resized to 224x224 pixels to match the training data size.
Conversion to Tensor: Converts the test images into tensors without additional augmentations to keep the test data standardized for evaluation.
These transformations aim to increase the model's generalization capability by creating diverse variations of the training data while maintaining the test data in its original form to accurately evaluate model performance.
