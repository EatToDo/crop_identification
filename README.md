# crop_identification

# Introduction
#### This project focuses on the development of a task recognition system using machine learning techniques to classify crop types from images. The primary goal is to accurately identify different types of crops from a given dataset, which includes images of ten different crops and bare land. Each class in the dataset contains 300 images with a resolution of 224x224 pixels.

#### The project is designed to implement a robust training and evaluation pipeline using PyTorch, applying various techniques such as data augmentation and regularization to improve model performance. The system's objective is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing crops, which has significant implications for agricultural analysis and precision farming.

##### Through this task recognition system, we aim to explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in image classification tasks, providing insights into the capabilities and limitations of the applied methodologies.

# Model Description
### The model architecture is based on a ResNet-based design for recognizing and classifying tasks.
### We employ techniques like data augmentation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
