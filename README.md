# Task Recognition System
### This repository contains machine learning models developed for a task recognition system. The project focuses on building and training models to recognize and classify tasks efficiently using various data inputs.

# Model Description
### The model architecture is based on a ResNet-based design for recognizing and classifying tasks.
### We employ techniques like data augmentation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
